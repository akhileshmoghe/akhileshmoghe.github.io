  * Evaluated Open-Source Edge Projects such as __*KubeEdge*__, __*ioFog*__, __*EdgeX*__, __*LF-Edge*__ Umbrella projects against identified use-cases.
  * Evaluated suitability of __*AWS IoT Greengrass*__ and __*Azure IoT Edge*__ + other AWS/Azure on-premises services for various Edge computing scenarios, presented pros & cons of both public cloud platforms and created various possible use-cases architecture/design with AWS/Azure as primary components of framework.
  * Architecting a common framework based on open-source Edge projects which can complement the public cloud services in on-premises Edge computing scenarios.

#### *<u>Jetson Nano based Healthcare IoT Device as a Guided Pipetting Tip Sensing System</u>*:
* __*Role*__: Systems Engineer (6 Months)
* __*Accomplishments*__:
  * Carried out PoC tasks like flashing boards to simulate mass flashing at factory, customizing RootFS, Secure Boot, Bootloader Splash Screen, Interfacing Bluetooth module with NVIDIA L4T BSP software for Jetson Nano. All these PoC tasks resulted in concrete plan to be executed at factory manufacturing.
  * Designed and implemented firmware, application, configuration and system update mechanism based on Mender-Yocto Open-Source project.
  * Designed and implemented device side IoT connectivity features like device registration, status, identity, user-device association, certificates management, file and device shadow upload/download.

* __*Role*__: Firmware Developer (4 Months)
* __*Accomplishments*__:
  * Designed and Implemented STM32F407 based MCU firmware to achieve USB communication with Android app using Virtual COM Port, Flash memory read/write, PWM generation.
  * Created a dummy test application in Python to automate the testing of STM32 firmware.
  * Received “Bravo Award” for the delivering the project in 3 months.
  * Client Received $2 Million funding to continue development based on our Project.

#### *<u>OTA Firmware Updates for a STM32 MCUs and full OS Updates for x86 carrier boards</u>*:
* __*Role*__: IoT Developer (14 Months)
* __*Accomplishments*__:
  * Designed and implemented custom bootloader with Dual Active/in-Active bank strategy for STM32F407 MCU to achieve robust firmware update requirements. MAVLink communication protocol and checksum verification were few of the other key features implemented.
  * Designed & developed Python3 module to achieve OTA firmware update for multiple STM32 MCUs connected to main CCB. AWS IoT Jobs, Device Shadow, Secure Cloud communication and UART based serial communication were few other key features.
  * PoC for full OS image and Application update using Mender.io Open-Sorce project. Full OS OTA updates with Mender server hosted on EC2. Also, same kind of updates with USB and over LAN were also achieved with local Python server.
  * Evaluated and finalized Ayla IoT platform for early market release without full fledge cloud development. Device provisioning, status, firmware updates to multiple devices, sensor data streaming were key features achieved in 4 months duration.
  * Designed and implemented a NodeJS module for Data Synchronization between device and cloud using MongoDB Realm and MongoDB Atlas cloud databases. Understanding of new platform and successful delivery was achieved in 3 months.

#### *<u>Drone-based Asset Inspection with AWS IoT Greengrass & AWS Robomaker Services</u>*:
* __*Role*__: Robotics, IoT Developer (8 Months)
* __*Accomplishments*__:
  * Demos were successfully showcased at CERAWeek 2019 and AWS re:MARS 2019 events § Drone simulation around oil-rig running in background in AWS official Tech Talk
  * Understanding of the new to be launched or recently launched AWS Services like Robomaker, Greengrass, AWS IoT and their use-cases for Robotics projects were achieved in 3 months with demonstratable applications as an outcome.
  * Robotics Drone applications had features like Rust and leakage detection Machine learning models deployments with AWS IoT Greengrass to multiple devices as drone, mobile robots and x86 machine. AWS IoT device shadow updates and IoT Jobs for firmware update were also used.
  * Drone application had features to capture and upload the thermal and normal camera videos to AWS S3 buckets, which were consumed by AWS Sagemaker for machine learning training.

#### *<u>WebMeeting (Screen Sharing Application) for MAC and Windows</u>*:
* __*Role*__: Backend Developer (26 Months)
* __*Accomplishments*__:
  * Received “You Made a Difference Award” for the extensive work done in the initial phase of the project, which helped the team to scale up and gain Client’s Confidence.
  * Understood the Chromium Projects relevant modules, build systems which can be reused to create a cross-platform Screen Sharing application which used VP8 video codec and WebM packetizer. Demonstrated the key functionality of screen sharing in couple of months.
  * Evaluated and AWS S3, Dropbox, Google Drive for file sharing capabilities, but Client did not pursue another cloud platform and file share was implemented with Firebase & PubNub.
  * Designed and developed HTTP transport modules for screen sharing data + Chats + Files sharing modules with Firebase & PubNub cloud platforms.
  * Later, it was developed into a full-fledged product with multiple browsers supports + Chat, file share, recording capabilities. The core screen sharing product is still in production.
