- Azure Digital Twins enables you to *<u>model the relationships and interactions</u>* between people, spaces, and devices.
- This ability allows you to *<u>create models of a physical environment</u>* that you're interested in analyzing. Once the environment has been modeled, you can *<u>run predictive algorithms to anticipate the behavior</u>* of the entire system.
- For example, you can optimize the use of available space for an office if the office is modeled through Digital Twins by replicating the physical space.
