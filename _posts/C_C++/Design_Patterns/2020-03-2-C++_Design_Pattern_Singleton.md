- __*<u>Aim</u>*__: *<u>To use single instance of a class throughout the lifetime of an application</u>*.
- Ways to achieve this:
  - __*<u>Global Object/Instance</u>*__:
    - In C++, it is possible to declare a global object, which can be used anywhere inside the program.
    - But a good object-oriented design strictly prohibits use of global variables/methods, since they are against fundamental principles of object orientation like data encapsulation or data hiding.
  - __*<u>A class with all Static Methods</u>*__:
    - Another practical solution to get a single object is by declaring a class, which contains only static methods.
    - A static class is loaded into memory when the execution of the program starts, and it remains there till the application ends.
    - Remember that for invoking a static method of a class, it is not necessary to create an instance of the class. But a class with only static methods and variables are not a good object-oriented design.
  
## Singleton Pattern:
- Used to create only one instance of a class in a truly object-oriented fashion.
- Used where only one instance of an object is needed throughout the lifetime of an application.
- The Singleton class is *<u>instantiated at the time of first access</u>* and same instance is used thereafter till the application quits.
- The Singleton Pattern comes under that classification of __*Creational Patterns*__, which deals with the best ways to create objects.
- Usually *<u>used along with other patterns</u>* e.g. [Abstract Factory](), [Builder](), [Prototype](), [Facade](), etc.
![Singleton_design](/assets/images/design_patterns/singleton/Singleton_design.jpg)

### <u>Usage</u>:
- The Singletons are often used to *<u>control access to resources</u>* such as "database connections" or "sockets". Suppose we have license for only one connection for our database. A Singleton connection object makes sure that only one connection can be made at any time.
- Your code creates *<u>multiple instances</u>* of an object, and that *<u>uses too much memory</u>* or slows system performance. Replace the multiple instances with a Singleton. Users of your system are complaining about *<u>system performance</u>*.
- Your profiler tells you that you can improve performance by not instantiating certain objects over and over again.
- The *<u>objects you want to share have no state or contain state that is sharable</u>*.

### <u>Cautions</u>:
- *<u>Misuse of Singleton</u>*:
  - Singletons are not same as Global Variables.
  - Singletons should be used to ensure that the object has only one instance and not to get that instance from everywhere.
- *<u>Benefits and Liabilities</u>*:
  - :heavy_check_mark: Improves performance
  - :x: Is easily accessible from anywhere. In many cases, this may indicate a design flaw.
  - :x: Is not useful when an object has state that can't be shared.

### <u>Object Pool</u>
- Itâ€™s a variation of Singleton Pattern.
- A set of objects exists e.g. a fixed number of database connections.
- Threads acquire and release instances.
- The Resource Pool to allocate and free connections is a singleton.

### <u>Implementing Singleton Pattern</u>:
- *<u>A private constructor</u>*: To create instance of the class
- *<u>A static method</u>*: To return same instance of the class
- *<u>A static instance variable</u>*: being static, it will persist in memory till program runs.
