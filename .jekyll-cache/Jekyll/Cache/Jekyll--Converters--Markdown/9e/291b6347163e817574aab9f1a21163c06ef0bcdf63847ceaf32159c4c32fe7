<em>â€œThank you everyone for all the hard work, effort, and late nights that you put into the <strong><u>Atlas</u></strong> hardware, firmware, and software development. We presented the Atlas device to the <u>Canadian government</u> today. The presentation and demonstration was a huge success! The government team was very impressed in all we accomplished in a very short time. Over the next few weeks, the govt team will be assessing the competing <strong><u>in-home Covid-19 test solutions</u></strong>. I will give you an update when I receive any news I can share with you.<br />
Â Â Â Â 
Again, thank you all for stepping up to meet the demands of this project. You can all be proud of this team accomplishment and you can brag to your friends and family that you work on projects that help to save the world!â€</em></p>
