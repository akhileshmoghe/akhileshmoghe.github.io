I"˜<p>This write-up explains different use cases of Private 5G Networks, specifically in IoT &amp; Edge-Computing domains.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-existing-enterprise-networks">Problems with existing Enterprise Networks</h2>
<p>Enterprise networks are under strain, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing internet connected-serving applications.</li>
  <li>Increasing number of users.</li>
  <li>Increasing number of Connected IoT Devices.</li>
  <li>Increased Video content consumption.</li>
  <li>Low Latency requirements.</li>
  <li>Wired networks are inflexible and expensive to expand</li>
  <li>Wi-Fi networks suffer from Coverage, Reliability &amp; Capacity issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advantages-of-5g-networks">Advantages of 5G Networks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reliable network connectivity for use cases that involve device mobility.</li>
  <li>Longer range than Wi-Fi networks.</li>
  <li>Better coverage, especially in industrial/hospital environments.</li>
  <li>Low-latency connectivity for IoT-Edge applications.</li>
  <li>Full enterprise control over users, devices, network utilization and data. Implement enterprise-specific network configuration and security policies.</li>
  <li>Convenience of CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) in the US with no need to acquire spectrum licenses.(US specific)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="private-5g-use-cases">Private 5G use-cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Indoor Scenarios such as Industrial Manufacturing Hub or Hospitals or Retail stores
    <ul>
      <li>Improved coverage and reliability close to wired networks with flexibility as Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li>Connect autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), automated guided vehicles (AGVs), video surveillance systems.</li>
      <li>Underground deployments, where cellular network is often difficult to reach, unreliable.
        <ul>
          <li>Mining sites can be a great scenario for connectivity to Iot Sensors, video surveillance.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Point-of-sale (PoS) transactions, video surveillance in Retail stores.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Outdoor Scenarios such as Transport Hubs
    <ul>
      <li>Increase range and penetration over Wi-Fi in shipping ports, airports, train and bus terminals.</li>
      <li>Reliable connectivity for IoT sensor data for predictive maintenance, video feeds for safety, push-to-talk (PTT) applications for communications.</li>
      <li>Remote Places where public network services are not available like Oil-Gas, Mining IIoT sites</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On-premise IoT-Edge-AI-ML Analysis
    <ul>
      <li>Low latency use-cases can be a reality as in case of Internet of Medical things (IoMT).</li>
      <li>Real-time AI-ML diagnosis on sensors, video data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Large Images/Videos data analysis
    <ul>
      <li>As in case of Radiology scans or live video, or Raw image data, which are relatively large chunks of data.</li>
      <li>with 5G low latency and dedicated network without the risk of channel interference, these loads can be transmitted in real-time and analysis be performed on it or it can be made available for remote monitoring or diagnosis services.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AR-VR applications
    <ul>
      <li>with all of the promises of 5G networks such as Low Latency, dedicated bandwidth, AR/VR application experiances can be made production grade, deployed and simultaneously used by large gatherings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aws-private-5g">AWS Private 5G</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It simplifies the procurement, deployment, and installation process</li>
  <li>Allowing customers to deploy their own 4G/LTE or 5G network.</li>
  <li>In the US, AWS Private 5G uses CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service), avoiding the need to procure spectrum licenses.</li>
  <li>Integration with Spectrum Access System (SAS) for FCC regulation compliance are handled by AWS.</li>
  <li>Delivers, provisions, and maintains all the preintegrated hardware, 5G Core and RAN software, and SIM cards.</li>
  <li>Small cell radio units (RUs) are deployed on premises and the 5G Core (5GC) software runs either in an AWS Region or on premises using AWS managed infrastructure (AWS Outposts).</li>
  <li>Setup Customized Bandwidths, Latency and Quality of Service (QoS) profiles for groups of devices and applications.</li>
  <li>Pricing is based on Network Coverage and Capacity requirements, but not the number of connected devices.</li>
  <li>Zero upfront charges for radio units, on-premises hardware, and SIMs. No installation charges or additional software licensing fees.</li>
  <li>Provision a private cellular network of any size.</li>
  <li>Expand coverage, and scale number of connected devices as needed.</li>
  <li>AWS IAM integration to manage access between AWS services and devices in the network.
    <ul>
      <li>5G-powered SIM cards are treated as IAM resources.</li>
      <li>Manage SIM control policies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amazon CloudWatch Monitoring
    <ul>
      <li>Query metrics for network status, connected APs or SIMs, uplink and downlink usage by user, device, network categories.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
